<objective>
Design a comprehensive course structure that maximizes learning effectiveness within the given constraints.
</objective>

<course-design-principles>
1. **Conceptual Organization**: Group related knowledge into logical, cohesive concepts that build upon each other
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Start with foundational concepts and advance to more complex ones
3. **Practical Application**: Include real-world connections and applications for each concept
4. **Balanced Coverage**: Ensure appropriate depth and breadth based on time and learning level
5. **Synthesis Opportunities**: Create connections between concepts for holistic understanding
</course-design-principles>

<output-requirements>
- **Course Name**: Clear, descriptive title reflecting the scope and level
- **Concepts**: 2-6 major learning modules covering distinct aspects of the topic
  - Each concept should be a meaningful unit of study
  - Concepts should have clear boundaries but natural connections
  - Order concepts from foundational to advanced
- **Drawing Connections**: 5-8 synthesis scenarios that integrate multiple concepts
  - Must present specific situations with constraints and trade-offs
  - Should require decision-making, not just explanation
  - Focus on realistic problems where multiple valid approaches exist
  - Avoid generic "explain how X relates to Y" prompts
  - Include edge cases, exceptions, or counter-intuitive situations
</output-requirements>

<depth-guidelines>
- Beginner: Focus on fundamental concepts, basic terminology, and practical applications
- Intermediate: Include underlying principles, comparative analysis, and nuanced understanding
- Advanced: Emphasize critical analysis, edge cases, current research, and expert-level insights
</depth-guidelines>

<time-guidelines>
- 30 minutes: 2-4 focused concepts with essential knowledge
- 1 hour: 3-6 comprehensive concepts with good coverage
- 2+ hours: 4-6 detailed concepts with extensive exploration

<objective>
Design comprehensive learning components for a specific concept within a larger course.
</objective>

<component-structure>
1. **High-Level Topics**: Conceptual understanding points that require explanation and discussion
   - Should cover theoretical foundations, principles, and relationships
   - Include practical applications and real-world relevance
   - Progress from basic to advanced understanding
   - Typically 8-12 topics for comprehensive coverage

2. **Memorization Items**: Concrete facts, terms, or data points to commit to memory
   - Fields: Column headers that capture MEANINGFUL, NON-OBVIOUS attributes specific to the concept
   - Items: Specific entries to memorize (just the names/terms, not full details)
   - Focus on essential facts that support conceptual understanding
   - Include 10-20 items for effective spaced repetition
</component-structure>

<field-generation-principles>
CRITICAL: Fields should be domain-specific and contextually relevant to what actually matters for learning the concept.

AVOID generic fields like:
- "Term" (the item IS the term)
- "Definition" (too generic, be more specific)
- "Description" (too vague)
- "Example" (unless examples are the primary learning objective)

INSTEAD create fields that capture:
- Quantitative measures or ranges specific to the domain
- Practical applications or use cases
- Distinguishing characteristics that differentiate items
- Relationships to other concepts or items
- Context-specific attributes that experts actually care about

Examples of good field sets:
- For wine sweetness levels: "Residual Sugar (g/L)", "Perceived Sweetness", "Food Pairings", "Common Wine Styles"
- For chemical elements: "Atomic Number", "Electron Configuration", "Common Compounds", "Industrial Uses"
- For historical events: "Date/Period", "Key Figures", "Causes", "Long-term Impact"
- For programming concepts: "Time Complexity", "Space Complexity", "Use Cases", "Trade-offs"
</field-generation-principles>

<quality-criteria>
- Ensure topics build progressively in complexity
- Balance theoretical knowledge with practical application
- Include diverse perspectives and contexts
- Make connections to related concepts explicit
- Choose memorization items that reinforce understanding
- Fields must add genuine learning value, not state the obvious
</quality-criteria>`,

  userPrompt: (
    courseName: string,
    conceptName: string,
    otherConcepts: string[],
    timeAvailable: string,

Course: ${courseName}
Concept: ${conceptName}
Other concepts in course: ${otherConcepts.join(", ")}
Time available: ${timeAvailable}
Depth level: ${depth}
</context>

<task>
Create a detailed learning structure for "${conceptName}" that includes:

1. **High-level topics** (8-12 items):
   - Core principles and theories
   - Key relationships and dependencies
   - Practical applications
   - Common patterns or variations
   - Important distinctions or comparisons

2. **Memorization structure**:
   - Fields: 3-5 column headers that capture MEANINGFUL, SPECIFIC attributes
   - Items: 10-20 specific terms/entities to memorize
   - Ensure items are concrete and memorable
   - Focus on the most important examples or instances

CRITICAL for memorization fields:
- DO NOT use generic fields like "Term", "Definition", "Description"
- Instead, think about what specific attributes matter for THIS concept
- For example, if the concept is about wine sweetness, use fields like "Residual Sugar Range", "Food Pairings", not "Term" and "Definition"
- Ask yourself: What would an expert actually need to know about each item?
- The fields should reveal non-obvious, useful information

Remember:
- For memorize.items, provide ONLY the item names/terms as strings
- For memorize.fields, provide domain-specific headers that add genuine learning value
- Ensure all content aligns with the course level and time constraints

<example-response-for-idk>
**❌ No answer provided.**

**The correct answer:**
• Wine structure consists of acidity (tartness), tannins (grip), and alcohol (body)
• Acidity ranges from 2.5-4.5 pH; tannins from polyphenols in skins/seeds/stems
• Alcohol typically 11-15% ABV, affects perception of other components

**Remember:** Higher alcohol amplifies tannin perception; higher acidity makes wine feel lighter.

**Question:** What specific compound in grape skins creates tannins, and at what temperature does it extract?

<example-response>
**❌ Incomplete:** Missing the chemical basis of acidity.

**The correct understanding:**
• Acidity comes from tartaric, malic, and citric acids (pH 2.9-3.8)
• Alcohol is ethanol from fermented sugars (11-15% ABV typical)
• Together they create "balance" - high acid needs more alcohol to not taste sharp

**Critical distinction:** Perceived acidity differs from measured pH due to buffering capacity.

**Question:** What specific acids are found in wine, and which one disappears during malolactic fermentation?
