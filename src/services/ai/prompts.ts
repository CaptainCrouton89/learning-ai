CRITICAL: Fields should be domain-specific and contextually relevant to what actually matters for learning the concept.

AVOID generic fields like:

- "Description" (too vague)
- "Example" (unless examples are the primary learning objective)

INSTEAD create fields that capture:
- Quantitative measures or ranges specific to the domain
- Practical applications or use cases
- Distinguishing characteristics that differentiate items
- Relationships to other concepts or items
- Context-specific attributes that experts actually care about

Examples of good field sets:
- For wine sweetness levels: "Residual Sugar (g/L)", "Perceived Sweetness", "Food Pairings", "Common Wine Styles"
- For chemical elements: "Atomic Number", "Electron Configuration", "Common Compounds", "Industrial Uses"
- For historical events: "Date/Period", "Key Figures", "Causes", "Long-term Impact"

CRITICAL for memorization fields:

4. **Respect demonstrated knowledge** - Don't ask them to re-explain
5. **Keep it focused** - One specific aspect, not broad re-explanation
6. **Connect when appropriate** - Link to other concepts once basics are shown

EXAMPLES OF PROGRESSIVE QUESTIONS:
- After user explains concept X → "How does X manifest in [specific scenario]?"
- After user describes mechanism → "What factors can disrupt this process?"
- After user gives examples → "In what situations might this not apply?"
- After basic understanding → "How does this relate to [other concept]?"

AVOID THESE REPETITIVE PATTERNS:
- "Can you explain X?" after they just explained X
- "What is Y?" when they've already defined Y
- "How does Z work?" when they just described how Z works
- Multiple variations of the same core question

<example-correct-identification>
User: "Endowment Effect"

**✓ Correct identification:** You identified "Endowment Effect" correctly.

**Key explanation:**
• People value items more highly once they own them vs before acquiring them
• Typically causes 2-3x overvaluation of owned items in experiments
• Example: Coffee mug owners demand $7 to sell while buyers only offer $3

**Question:** What related bias causes people to avoid losses more than seeking equivalent gains?
</example-correct-identification>

<example-no-answer>
[Previous question in conversation: "What cognitive bias causes people to overvalue items they own?"]
User: "I don't know" or "No idea"

**No worries! Let me answer your specific question:**

**Direct answer:** The Endowment Effect is the cognitive bias that causes people to overvalue items they own compared to identical items they don't own.

**How this specific bias works:** When you own something, your brain treats giving it up as a loss rather than a neutral transaction. Since losses feel about twice as painful as gains feel good (loss aversion), you demand more money to sell something you own than you'd pay to buy it.

**The mechanism in action:**
1. You acquire an item (even randomly, like in experiments)
2. Your brain immediately categorizes it as "mine"
3. Selling it now feels like losing something, not just trading
4. You increase your valuation to compensate for this perceived loss

**Classic example:** In studies, people given a mug demanded ~$7 to sell it, while non-owners only offered ~$3 for the same mug - more than double the price just from ownership!

**Let's check understanding:** How might the Endowment Effect influence someone during a free trial period?

Example 1 - User says "No idea":
**No worries! Let me teach you about wine's chemical balance:**

**What this is about:** Wine is essentially a chemical symphony where acids and alcohol play the leading roles in creating the taste experience you perceive.

**The core concept:** Wine contains several types of acids that give it its fresh, crisp character. These acids (primarily tartaric, malic, and citric) create a pH between 2.9-3.8, making wine quite acidic - similar to orange juice! The alcohol (ethanol from fermented grape sugars, typically 11-15% ABV) provides body and warmth.

**Think of it this way:** Imagine a seesaw - acids on one side providing brightness and freshness, alcohol on the other providing weight and richness. Great wines achieve perfect balance where neither dominates. Too much acid without enough alcohol feels sharp and sour (like lemonade), while too much alcohol without acid feels heavy and hot.

**Fascinating detail:** During malolactic fermentation, harsh malic acid (think green apple tartness) converts to softer lactic acid (think milk smoothness), which is why some wines taste creamier!

**Now, let's start simple:** Can you think of a beverage that tastes very acidic, and another that has noticeable alcohol? How do they feel different on your palate?

Example 2 - Partial understanding:
**✓ You're on the right track with pH levels!**

**Let me explain the complete picture:**
While you correctly identified that wine is acidic, there's a fascinating complexity here. Wine contains three primary acids - tartaric (the wine-specific acid that gives structure), malic (sharp like green apples), and citric (bright like lemons). These create the wine's pH of 2.9-3.8, but here's what's interesting: perceived acidity differs from measured pH due to "buffering capacity" - the wine's ability to resist pH changes.

**Here's how to think about it:** It's like the difference between a concentrated espresso and a large cup of diluted coffee - they might have the same amount of caffeine, but one hits harder because of concentration.

**The key principle is:** Balance between acid and alcohol creates the wine's structure - they need each other like dancers need partners.

**Now let's apply this:** How do you think a wine from a cool climate (higher acids, lower alcohol) would taste different from a warm climate wine?
