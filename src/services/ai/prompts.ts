<course-design-principles>
1. **Conceptual Organization**: Group related knowledge into logical, cohesive concepts that build upon each other
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Start with foundational concepts and advance to more complex ones
3. **Practical Application**: Include real-world connections and applications for each concept
4. **Balanced Coverage**: Ensure appropriate depth and breadth based on time and learning level
5. **Synthesis Opportunities**: Create connections between concepts for holistic understanding
</course-design-principles>

<output-requirements>
- **Course Name**: Clear, descriptive title reflecting the scope and level
- **Concepts**: 2-6 major learning modules covering distinct aspects of the topic
  - Each concept should be a meaningful unit of study
  - Concepts should have clear boundaries but natural connections
  - Order concepts from foundational to advanced
- **Drawing Connections**: 5-8 synthesis questions/scenarios that integrate multiple concepts
  - These should require applying knowledge from different concepts together
  - Focus on real-world applications, case studies, or complex scenarios
</output-requirements>

<depth-guidelines>
- Beginner: Focus on fundamental concepts, basic terminology, and practical applications
- Intermediate: Include underlying principles, comparative analysis, and nuanced understanding
- Advanced: Emphasize critical analysis, edge cases, current research, and expert-level insights

<objective>
Design comprehensive learning components for a specific concept within a larger course.

<component-structure>
1. **High-Level Topics**: Conceptual understanding points that require explanation and discussion
   - Should cover theoretical foundations, principles, and relationships
   - Include practical applications and real-world relevance
   - Progress from basic to advanced understanding
   - Typically 8-12 topics for comprehensive coverage

2. **Memorization Items**: Concrete facts, terms, or data points to commit to memory
   - Fields: Column headers describing aspects to learn (e.g., "Term", "Definition", "Key Features", "Example")
   - Items: Specific entries to memorize (just the names/terms, not full details)
   - Focus on essential facts that support conceptual understanding
   - Include 10-20 items for effective spaced repetition
</component-structure>

<quality-criteria>
- Ensure topics build progressively in complexity
- Balance theoretical knowledge with practical application
- Include diverse perspectives and contexts
- Make connections to related concepts explicit
- Choose memorization items that reinforce understanding

Create a detailed learning structure for "${conceptName}" that includes:

1. **High-level topics** (8-12 items):
   - Core principles and theories
   - Key relationships and dependencies
   - Practical applications
   - Common patterns or variations
   - Important distinctions or comparisons

2. **Memorization structure**:
   - Fields: 3-5 column headers that capture essential aspects
   - Items: 10-20 specific terms/entities to memorize
   - Ensure items are concrete and memorable
   - Focus on the most important examples or instances

Remember:
- For memorize.items, provide ONLY the item names/terms as strings
- For memorize.fields, provide descriptive headers for what to learn about each item
- Ensure all content aligns with the course level and time constraints
