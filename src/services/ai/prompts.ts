CRITICAL: Fields should be domain-specific and contextually relevant to what actually matters for learning the concept.

AVOID generic fields like:
- "Term" (the item IS the term)
- "Definition" (too generic, be more specific)
- "Description" (too vague)
- "Example" (unless examples are the primary learning objective)

INSTEAD create fields that capture:
- Quantitative measures or ranges specific to the domain
- Practical applications or use cases
- Distinguishing characteristics that differentiate items
- Relationships to other concepts or items
- Context-specific attributes that experts actually care about

Examples of good field sets:
- For wine sweetness levels: "Residual Sugar (g/L)", "Perceived Sweetness", "Food Pairings", "Common Wine Styles"
- For chemical elements: "Atomic Number", "Electron Configuration", "Common Compounds", "Industrial Uses"
- For historical events: "Date/Period", "Key Figures", "Causes", "Long-term Impact"
- For programming concepts: "Time Complexity", "Space Complexity", "Use Cases", "Trade-offs"

   - Fields: 3-4 column headers (domain-specific, meaningful)
   - Items: Scale quantity to time available
   - Focus on the MOST critical items only
   - Adapt quantity based on subject domain

CRITICAL for memorization fields:
- DO NOT use generic fields like "Term", "Definition", "Description"
- Instead, think about what specific attributes matter for THIS concept
- For example, if the concept is about wine sweetness, use fields like "Residual Sugar Range", "Food Pairings", not "Term" and "Definition"
- Ask yourself: What would an expert actually need to know about each item?
- The fields should reveal non-obvious, useful information

Remember:
- For memorize.items, provide ONLY the item names/terms as strings
- For memorize.fields, provide domain-specific headers that add genuine learning value

User: "Endowment Effect"

**✓ Correct identification:** You identified "Endowment Effect" correctly.

**Key explanation:**
• People value items more highly once they own them vs before acquiring them
• Typically causes 2-3x overvaluation of owned items in experiments
• Example: Coffee mug owners demand $7 to sell while buyers only offer $3

**Question:** What related bias causes people to avoid losses more than seeking equivalent gains?
</example-correct-identification>

<example-no-answer>
**❌ No answer provided.**

**The correct answer:**
• The Endowment Effect: overvaluing what we already possess
• Caused by loss aversion - losses feel worse than equivalent gains feel good
• Classic study: Students with mugs wanted 2x what students without would pay

**Remember:** Ownership creates emotional attachment that inflates perceived value.

**Question:** How does the Endowment Effect influence pricing strategies in free trials?

• Alcohol is ethanol from fermented sugars (11-15% ABV typical)
• Together they create "balance" - high acid needs more alcohol to not taste sharp
