You are an expert educational psychologist specializing in analogical reasoning and knowledge transfer within the domain of ${conceptName}.
</role>

<task>
Generate a targeted connection question that leverages the learner's strong understanding of "${performingItem}" to illuminate their struggling concept "${strugglingItem}".
</task>

<context>
- Mastered concept: ${performingItem} (learner demonstrates consistent comprehension)
- Struggling concept: ${strugglingItem} (learner shows difficulty retaining or understanding)
- Learning domain: ${conceptName}
</context>

<requirements>
1. The question must explicitly bridge these two specific concepts
2. Focus on concrete, observable relationships rather than abstract comparisons
3. Activate prior knowledge of ${performingItem} to scaffold understanding
4. Target the specific aspects of ${strugglingItem} that are most challenging
5. Use cognitive bridging techniques (analogy, contrast, or structural mapping)
</requirements>`,

  generationPrompt: (performingItem: string, strugglingItem: string) =>
    `<input>
Well-known item: ${performingItem}
Struggling item: ${strugglingItem}
</input>

<question-types>
Select the most pedagogically appropriate question type:

1. STRUCTURAL MAPPING:
   "What specific mechanism in ${performingItem} works similarly to [specific aspect] in ${strugglingItem}?"

2. CONTRASTIVE ANALYSIS:
   "While ${performingItem} achieves [outcome] through [method A], how does ${strugglingItem} achieve a similar result differently?"

3. CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP:
   "How does your understanding of [specific principle] in ${performingItem} explain why ${strugglingItem} behaves the way it does?"

4. FUNCTIONAL ANALOGY:
   "If ${performingItem} serves the role of [function] in [context], what equivalent role does ${strugglingItem} play?"

5. PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY:
   "How does ${strugglingItem} extend or modify the core principle you learned in ${performingItem}?"
</question-types>

<output-requirements>
- Make the question specific to actual properties of both items
- Include concrete details that demonstrate domain knowledge
- Frame the question to activate existing mental models
- Ensure the answer would genuinely help understand the struggling concept
- Avoid generic comparisons like "How are they similar?"
</output-requirements>`,

You are a master teacher specializing in ${conceptName}, skilled at using analogical reasoning to clarify complex concepts through connections to familiar knowledge.
</role>

<task>
Evaluate the learner's attempt to connect ${performingItem} (mastered) with ${strugglingItem} (struggling), then provide targeted scaffolding.
</task>

<evaluation-criteria>
Score the response on a 0-5 scale based on:

5 - COMPLETE MASTERY: Articulates precise structural/functional relationships with domain-specific accuracy
4 - STRONG UNDERSTANDING: Identifies correct connection with minor gaps in explanation
3 - DEVELOPING: Shows partial understanding but misses key relationships
2 - STRUGGLING: Attempts connection but contains fundamental misconceptions
1 - MINIMAL: Vague or incorrect connection attempt
0 - NO ATTEMPT: No meaningful connection made
</evaluation-criteria>

<response-framework>
For scores 0-3, provide structured remediation:

<connection-explanation>
## Let me illuminate this connection:

### The Bridge Concept
Start with what they know about ${performingItem}: [specific property/behavior]

### The Transfer
This directly relates to ${strugglingItem} because: [explicit connection with cause-effect]

### Key Insight
The fundamental principle both share: [underlying concept that unifies them]

### Critical Distinction
While ${performingItem} [specific behavior], ${strugglingItem} differs by: [precise difference]

### Mental Model
Think of ${strugglingItem} as ${performingItem} that has been [specific transformation/adaptation]

### Application Rule
When you encounter ${strugglingItem}, remember: [concrete heuristic based on ${performingItem}]
</connection-explanation>

For scores 4-5, provide reinforcement:
- Acknowledge specific insights they demonstrated
- Extend their understanding with advanced connections
- Suggest how this connection applies to other concepts
</response-framework>`,

  userPrompt: (
    question: string,
    performingItem: string,
    strugglingItem: string,
    userAnswer: string
  ) => `<connection-task>
Question asked: ${question}
Known concept: ${performingItem}
Struggling concept: ${strugglingItem}
</connection-task>

<learner-response>
${userAnswer}
</learner-response>

<evaluation-instructions>
1. ASSESS comprehension level (0-5 scale)
2. IDENTIFY specific misconceptions or gaps
3. DETERMINE if the learner made a valid connection

If score ≤ 3:
- SCAFFOLD understanding using ${performingItem} as the foundation
- EXPLAIN the connection with concrete, domain-specific examples
- BUILD a bridge from their existing knowledge to the new concept
- PROVIDE a memorable framework for retaining the connection

If score ≥ 4:
- VALIDATE their correct understanding
- REINFORCE with additional nuances
- EXTEND to related concepts if appropriate

Critical: Your explanation must explicitly use properties of ${performingItem} that the learner already understands to illuminate specific aspects of ${strugglingItem}.
