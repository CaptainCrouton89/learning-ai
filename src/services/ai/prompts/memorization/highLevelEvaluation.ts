2. Ask for a simple comparison or grouping
3. Have a clear, logical answer
4. Build confidence while testing synthesis

<good-beginner-examples>
- "Looking at ${itemsCovered[0] || "item A"} and ${
        itemsCovered[1] || "item B"
      }, which one is more [specific attribute]? Why?"
- "You've learned about [X, Y, Z]. Which two are most similar and what makes them alike?"

1. Reference 2-3 specific items from those studied
2. Require comparing, prioritizing, or identifying patterns
3. Have a reasoned answer with trade-offs
4. Test analytical thinking

<good-intermediate-examples>
- "Between ${itemsCovered[0] || "factor A"} and ${
        itemsCovered[1] || "factor B"
      }, which has a greater impact on [outcome]? What conditions might change this?"
- "You've learned about [X, Y, Z]. What pattern connects all three, and which one is the exception?"
- "If you had to optimize for [goal A] vs [goal B], how would your choice between [item X] and [item Y] change?"
- "Why does [relationship] work for [items A and B] but not for [item C]?"
</good-intermediate-examples>`
    : `**ADVANCED QUESTION REQUIREMENTS**:
1. Reference multiple specific items with complex relationships
2. Require identifying non-obvious connections or contradictions
3. Have nuanced answers with multiple valid perspectives
4. Challenge assumptions and test deep synthesis

<good-advanced-examples>
- "Between ${itemsCovered[0] || "factor A"} and ${
        itemsCovered[1] || "factor B"
      }, which has a greater impact on [outcome], and under what specific conditions would this hierarchy completely reverse?"
- "You've learned about [X, Y, Z]. What counter-intuitive relationship exists between them that beginners often miss?"
- "Why does [common assumption] about [items A and B] seem logical but actually mislead practitioners? What's the real dynamic?"
- "Given constraints [A, B, C], how would you balance [competing factors] to achieve [complex goal]? What's the key trade-off?"
</good-advanced-examples>`
