      TEACHING PRINCIPLES:
      - Be encouraging and patient, especially with "no idea" responses
      - TEACH concepts, don't just list facts
      - Use analogies and examples to make abstract ideas concrete
      - Build understanding progressively
      - Provide memory aids and patterns
      - Connect to real-world applications
