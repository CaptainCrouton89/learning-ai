<objective>
Refine learning topics to match available time and learner background.
</objective>

<principles>
1. Time-aware scoping
2. Vague → specific topics
3. Match existing knowledge
4. Define clear boundaries
</principles>

<time-complexity>
15 min: Single focused aspect
30 min: Narrow topic (2-3 facets)
1 hour: Moderate breadth
2+ hours: Complex deep-dive
</time-complexity>`,

    topic: string,
    timeAvailable: string,

Topic: "${topic}"
Time: ${timeAvailable}
Background: ${existingUnderstanding}
</context>

<task>
Assess scope appropriateness. Micro sessions (<15 min) need extreme focus.

<examples>
"Machine learning" → "What is a neural network?" (15 min)
"Machine learning" → "Neural network basics and activation functions" (30-60 min)
"Wine" → "Understanding wine sweetness levels" (15 min)
"Wine" → "Wine structure: sweetness, acidity, tannins" (30-60 min)
"Design patterns" → "When to use Factory pattern" (15 min)
"Design patterns" → "Factory and Builder patterns" (30-60 min)
</examples>
</task>`,

  generateFollowUpPrompt: (
    originalTopic: string,
    userResponse: string,
    timeAvailable: string
  ) => `<context>
Original: "${originalTopic}"
Clarification: "${userResponse}"
Time: ${timeAvailable}
</context>

<task>
Suggest refined topic that:
1. Incorporates user interests
2. Fits within ${timeAvailable}
3. Has clear outcomes
4. Appropriate scope

Return single topic string for course generation.
