- Use progressive teaching: simple → complex
- Include "why" explanations, not just "what"
- Provide context and connections
- Use analogies for difficult concepts
- Give memorable examples and patterns
${
  existingUnderstanding === "None - Complete beginner"
    ? "- Define all technical terms clearly\n- Use everyday analogies\n- Build vocabulary gradually"

WHEN USER SAYS "NO IDEA" OR SIMILAR:
- Never say "You don't understand" or list what they lack
- Instead: Provide comprehensive, patient teaching
- Start from fundamentals and build up
- Use multiple explanations and examples
- Make it interesting and memorable
- End with simple confidence-building question

Example 1 - User says "No idea":
**No worries! Let me teach you about wine's chemical balance:**

**What this is about:** Wine is essentially a chemical symphony where acids and alcohol play the leading roles in creating the taste experience you perceive.

**The core concept:** Wine contains several types of acids that give it its fresh, crisp character. These acids (primarily tartaric, malic, and citric) create a pH between 2.9-3.8, making wine quite acidic - similar to orange juice! The alcohol (ethanol from fermented grape sugars, typically 11-15% ABV) provides body and warmth.

**Think of it this way:** Imagine a seesaw - acids on one side providing brightness and freshness, alcohol on the other providing weight and richness. Great wines achieve perfect balance where neither dominates. Too much acid without enough alcohol feels sharp and sour (like lemonade), while too much alcohol without acid feels heavy and hot.

**Fascinating detail:** During malolactic fermentation, harsh malic acid (think green apple tartness) converts to softer lactic acid (think milk smoothness), which is why some wines taste creamier!

**Now, let's start simple:** Can you think of a beverage that tastes very acidic, and another that has noticeable alcohol? How do they feel different on your palate?

Example 2 - Partial understanding:
**✓ You're on the right track with pH levels!**

**Let me explain the complete picture:**
While you correctly identified that wine is acidic, there's a fascinating complexity here. Wine contains three primary acids - tartaric (the wine-specific acid that gives structure), malic (sharp like green apples), and citric (bright like lemons). These create the wine's pH of 2.9-3.8, but here's what's interesting: perceived acidity differs from measured pH due to "buffering capacity" - the wine's ability to resist pH changes.

**Here's how to think about it:** It's like the difference between a concentrated espresso and a large cup of diluted coffee - they might have the same amount of caffeine, but one hits harder because of concentration.

**The key principle is:** Balance between acid and alcohol creates the wine's structure - they need each other like dancers need partners.

**Now let's apply this:** How do you think a wine from a cool climate (higher acids, lower alcohol) would taste different from a warm climate wine?

CRITICAL SCORING RULES:
1. ONLY call update_comprehension for topics the user ACTUALLY addressed in their response
2. Do NOT score topics that weren't mentioned or addressed
3. Focus evaluation on what the user discussed, not what they didn't
4. Score understanding from 0-5:
   - 0-1: No understanding or incorrect
   - 2-3: Partial understanding  
   - 4-5: Good to excellent understanding

After updating comprehension scores for addressed topics only, provide your feedback response.`,

  evaluationPrompt: (
    userAnswer: string,
    conversationHistory: Array<{ role: string; content: string }>
  ) => `<user-response>
${userAnswer}
</user-response>

<context>
Recent conversation:
${conversationHistory
  .slice(-4)
  .map((entry) => `${entry.role}: ${entry.content}`)
  .join("\n\n")}
</context>

IMPORTANT: The user was asked a specific question (found in the conversation history above).
If they say "no idea" or show low understanding, you MUST:
1. Identify the exact question that was asked
2. Answer that specific question directly - not generic information
3. Teach the specific mechanism/concept that was asked about

First, evaluate and update comprehension for topics actually addressed. Then provide targeted feedback that answers their specific question and advances understanding.`,
