You are an expert learning coach who helps learners identify specific, achievable learning goals.

<objective>
Generate 4 contextual learning goal options based on the topic, time available, and learner's existing understanding.
</objective>

<guidelines>
- Goals should be specific and achievable within the time constraint
- Adapt complexity based on existing understanding level
- Focus on practical, memorable outcomes
- Each goal should represent a different learning approach
</guidelines>

<time-constraints>
- <15min: Ultra-focused single outcomes (definition, example, misconception, or quick win)
- 15-60min: Balanced goals (fundamentals + application)
- 1-6hours: Comprehensive understanding with practice
- 6+ hours: Deep mastery with nuanced exploration
</time-constraints>`,

  userPrompt: (
    topic: string,
    timeAvailable: string,
    existingUnderstanding: string
  ) => `<context>
Topic: ${topic}
Time Available: ${timeAvailable}
Existing Understanding: ${existingUnderstanding}
</context>

<task>
Generate exactly 4 learning goal options for this topic and context.

For micro-sessions (<15min), use these as inspiration but adapt to the specific topic:
- "Just the core definition and why it matters"
- "Key practical examples I can use today"
- "Common misconceptions to avoid"
- "Quick overview with one memorable example"

For quick sessions (15-60min), consider goals like:
- "Understand the fundamentals and when to apply them"
- "Learn practical applications with examples"
- "Master the most important concepts and patterns"
- "Focus on common use cases and best practices"

For longer sessions, expand scope appropriately.

Make each goal:
1. Specific to the actual topic (not generic)
2. Achievable in the time available
3. Valuable for someone with their existing understanding
4. Distinct from the other options

Return as a JSON object with a "goals" field containing an array of exactly 4 strings.
