**Engineering/CS**: 70-80% conceptual (patterns, trade-offs)
**Philosophy/Theory**: 80-90% conceptual (analysis, arguments)
**History/Languages**: 50-50 balanced (facts + context)
**Applied Skills**: 60% practice (procedures, decisions)

<output-structure>
- **Course Name**: Include time expectation (e.g., "Quick Intro to X" for 15min)
- **Background Knowledge**: Prerequisites to TEACH in overview phase
  - Scale by understanding level (more for beginners, minimal for experts)
  - Example: "Endowment Effect" needs "loss aversion", "cognitive bias"
- **Concepts**: Limited by time, ordered by dependency
- **Drawing Connections**: Specific scenarios requiring trade-off analysis
</output-structure>

<understanding-levels>
- **Beginner**: Start with fundamentals, define all terms
- **Intermediate**: Skip basics, focus on application
- **Advanced**: Edge cases, current debates, expert techniques
